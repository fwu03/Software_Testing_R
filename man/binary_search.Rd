\title{Binary Search}
\usage{
binary_search(x, lst)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{: numeric value less than 1000.}

\item{lst}{: sorted vector of numerics}
}
\value{
a list: First character represents a logical value (TRUE/FALSE). Second character represents a numeric value of x. Third character represents a numeric in range of 1 to length(lst) where NA indicates the element is not in the list
}
\description{
The function applies the generic binary search algorithm to search if the value
x exists in the lst, and returns a vector contains: TRUE/FAlSE depends on whether the x value has been found,
x value, and x position index in lst
}
\examples{

binary_search(4, c(1,2,3,4,5,6))
c('TRUE','4','4')

binary_search(5, c(10,100,200,300))
c('FALSE','5','0')
